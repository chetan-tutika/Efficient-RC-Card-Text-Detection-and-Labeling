# Efficient-RC-Card-Text-Detection-and-Labelling
Using tesseract for detecting words from image is a very common and very faulty without any processing. I wanted to design an algorithm to increase the efficiency of the words recognized by passing through various steps of processing before sending the image through tesseract for character recognition and labelling.
